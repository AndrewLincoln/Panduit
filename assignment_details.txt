basic understanding of Java, application design, coding style and algorithm and data
structure mastery. The application does not have to be functionally complete, but the more complete
the better.


Write a small graph library to create (add edges and vertices), manipulate (add/remove edges and
vertices) and query (retrieve edges for vertex, determine connectivity) a graph data structure. Include
automated tests for your code.
Some or all of the following features can also be implemented. If you choose not to, be prepared to
describe how you would do so during the interview.
- Allow edges to have a direction.
- Allow edges to have labels.
- Allow edges to have weights.
- Allow the graph to be stored on disk or transmitted across a network.
- Allow the graph to be manipulated and queried safely from multiple threads.
- Find the shortest path between 2 vertices (bonus points if this uses weighted edges).

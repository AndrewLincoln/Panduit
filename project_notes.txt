JRE System Library jre1.8.0_181
I used Eclipse IDE for Java Developers, Version: 2018-12 (4.10.0), Build id: 20181214-0600

Things I would want to enhance in the future:
	Verbosity of the debug statements, and ability to change it on the fly
	More constructors for vertex/edge? allow for more variation in creation?
	Keep a log of all commands run? error log?
	Ability to open a graph from a file and populate the Graph automatically
	Additional graphing functionality (shortest path, determine if there are any cycles, determine if there is a path b/w 2 vertices, etc)
	Raising errors when needed
	Make it thread-safe
	More test cases to increase coverage
	Better comments. Always need to improve comments!
	More consistency in code writing/ code calls.
	Better variable names.
	
I would be open to a design change. It was written this way to keep the Vertex and Edge objects from leaving Graph.
The design was the hardest decision to make for this assignment, but once it was made the implementation was not too difficult.

All code was written by me or auto-generated by Eclipse.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
